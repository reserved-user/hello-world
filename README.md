# hello-world
First steps on the roadmap to front-end development. I'm new to this and learning how to use github. Planning to do a traineeship in the coming year and switch careers.

A small blurb about me: I completed my degree in arts school as an illustration a couple of years ago. At the moment I'm juggling between working as a freelancer and a cook. Persuing a change into web-development is something that I seriously started to think about a month ago. Complex thought, abstracted thinking is something i'm quite adept to, and something that comes back in my illustrative work. The years prior to this I had some intimations of doing this, and now they have come into fruition.
